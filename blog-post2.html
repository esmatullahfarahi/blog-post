                  San Diego's biggest allure lies in its stunning coastline,

                  and beach bums soak up the sun, to the family-friendly shores
                  of Coronado Beach, where you can spot the iconic Hotel del
                  Coronado, every stretch of sand has its charm. Don't miss La
                  Jolla Cove, a picturesque spot perfect for snorkeling,
                  kayaking, and spotting seals and sea lions in their natural
